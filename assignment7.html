            <h1>A7: Final Project Proposal</h1>
      
            <p>
For the final project I am creating a wine rack with attached wine glass holder. While looking for inspiration I found a cute wood wine rack shaped like an elephant on pinterest. To incorporate all the techniques used in class I am adding glass holders to the rack.

<h2>Concept sketch:</h2>
<img src="Sketchfinal.jpeg" width=450 height=450></a></br></br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1. In order to add a glass holder I modified the ‘ears’ of the elephant to include a notch on both sides. I would also probably tilt the front of the elephant a little up in order to keep the wine in a tilted position facing upward.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2. I would also include CNC milled teeth.</br></br></br></br>


<h2>Intended use case:</h2>

The wine rack would be used to store opened/unopened bottle of red wine and would keep the wine taste better longer as the tilt would help the wine to breathe.</br></br>

<h2>Context:</h2>

I was looking to buy a single bottle wine holder for open red wine bottle at my home. So thought this could be done for the final project.</br></br>

<h2>Breakdown of tasks:</h2>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1. The base of the wine rack would be made from plywood and modelled in illustrator and cut using laser cutter at the MILL.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2. The teeth of the elephant would be designed using grasshopper.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3. Then they would be CNC milled on FR1.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 4. The wine glass holder attachment will be created using Rhino and will be 3D printed.</br></br>

<h2>Timeline with contingency plans:</h2>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1. Designing and modelling of the parts(wine rack, teeth, glass holder) will be done 27- 30th May.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2. Wine Rack starting 27th May</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3. Teeth, Glass holder starting 28th May</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 4. Material ordering/buying on 27th May</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 5. Laser cutting at the MILL - May 31st</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 6. CNC Milling - June 1st</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 7. 3D printing - June 1st</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 8. Remodel/rework the designs(if needed) - June 2nd</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 9. Reprint/recut at the MILL/ Assemble the model/ documentation - June 3rd - June 4th</br></br>

<h2>Bill of Materials:</h2>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1. Plywood = Home Depot(bought)</br> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2. 3D printer filament = Amazon(Delivery on the way)</br> 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3. FR1 = Leftover from previous project(available)</br> </br>
