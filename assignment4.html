            For this assignment I wanted to make something fun, so I decided to make a pinwheel!</br></br>
            I started by sketching the parts.</br></br>

            <img src="Paper prototype.jpeg" width=450 height=450></br></br></br></br>

Then I moved on to create the shapes in Onshape which went pretty smooth.</br></br>
Sizing:</br></br>
Rivet size(max) = 8mm</br>
Rivet size(min) = 6mm</br></br>

Acrylic sheet thickness = 2.1 mm</br></br>

After creating the shapes in Onshape, I exported the shapes onto Illustrator individually and placed them together in order to cut them using the laser cutter.</br>

Final shapes created using Illustrator:</br>

</br></br></br>

I went ahead and cut the shapes on an acrylic sheet using the laser cutter. </br>
I used lab recommended settings.</br></br>
Thickness of Notches = 0.1 in</br></br>

Speed = 8%</br>
Power = 100%</br>
Frequency = 100%</br></br>

I created a similar pentagon shape in rhino to 3d print later in a different color than the above shapes to add a little color contrast. But when I tried to extrude the shape it did not fill the whole thing and would just fill in the sides, so when I 3d printed, it would just give me a shape outline and not a solid pentagon. I tried to get help from the Mill staff but was not able to fill in the pentagon solid. So, on the recommendation of the Mill staff, I used 'Autodesk Inventor' and successfully created the shape.</br></br>

I went ahead and 3d printed six instances of the pentagon to add to the vines in different places.</br></br>

Printed parts:</br>

When I tried to assemble the vines with the round top, the top part of the vine near the notch became too thin and thus broke . I faced similar difficulty when connecting the 3d printed pentagons to the base of the vines. I later found out that the thickness of the acrylic sheet varied across its length, because of which some notches became too big, while others were too small and led to slipping off of the pieces. </br></br>

Because of the breaking and parts falling off of the vines, I had to rethink the whole design and because I had so many parts that were either too big or too small, I used pieces from my previous assignment which perfectly fit the notch size in the acrylic sheet cut round top.</br></br>

I also modified the design to add only 6 vines as the rest broke while assembling, so I added the pantagons on the remaining 6 notches and created alternate hanging pentagons.</br></br></br>

Though this was not the anticipated outcome, I did learn quite a lot while working on the assignment.</br></br></br>

Things to consider next time:</br></br>
1. Keep the fragility of material in mind while creating shapes.</br>
2. Keep a reasonable space between a notch and overall shape.</br>
3. Be flexible and use the tool that best suits your design, keeping in mind the time constraints.</br></br></br>

Thanks to Dhwani for helping with the preparation of file to 3d print and to the Mill staff for all the help with the 3d printer.</br></br>
