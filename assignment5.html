            For this assignment, I got inspired by Joshua box example in class and I tried to create a similar box.

I started by creating sides in onshape. I wanted to have 3 kinds of shapes for the 6 sides of the cube. It was difficult to figure out the placement of notches, so I did paper prototyping to figure out the sides.</br></br>

Once, I did that I created the shapes in Onshape and exported the DXF files to kiCad. In kiCad I faced some issues, the parts did not show up as in Onshape but exported as solid figures.
So after talking with Lucas I came to know that we need to add a 0 to the 'Line width' and change the value of 'import scale' from 1.0000 to 25.4 to convert to mm scale!</br></br>

kiCad on my laptop didn't show the button to add origin somehow, so I added the origin using the top nav bar option:</br>
Place -> Grid Origin</br></br>

FR1 dimensions: </br></br>
Thickness = 0.06 in</br></br>
Length = 10 cm</br></br>
Width = 7 cm</br></br>


After creating the shapes in Onshape, I exported the shapes onto Illustrator individually and placed them together in order to cut them using the laser cutter.</br>

Final shapes created using Illustrator:</br>

I went ahead and cut the shapes on an acrylic sheet using the laser cutter. </br>
I used lab recommended settings.</br></br>

Speed = 8%</br>
Power = 100%</br>
Frequency = 100%</br></br>

When I tried to assemble the round shapes with the stick shape, the fit was very lose and the rivet on the outer shapes got stuck on the stick and did not rotate fully.</br></br>

As I did not have any acrylic sheet left, I tried to add the outer shapes on the central flower shaped piece along with the stick. The fit was perfect and all the pieces moved smoothly, but the created object was very simple. </br></br>
