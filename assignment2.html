            I started with creating an updated version of my previous design. </br>
I created a round shape first with 12 equidistant notches, saved the rhino file but didnâ€™t realize that I had to save the grasshopper file separately as well. Redid the circle, and found it difficult to make a moon shape in rhino with notches in the position I wanted. I did this for 2 days and then realized it was better to make something new and simple for this assignment as Rhino-Grasshopper has a steep learning curve. </br>
</br></br>
Thanks Nadia for providing the tutorial, it was very helpful! </br></br>

I created a circle and square shape with 4 notches each. </br></br>

Thickness of Notches: 2.1mm and 2.5mm</br></br>
